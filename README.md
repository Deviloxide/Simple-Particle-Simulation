# Simple-Particle-Simulation (Falling Sand)
Based on the following Nifty Assignment from 2017: http://nifty.stanford.edu/2017/feinberg-falling-sand/assignment.html

## Elements
There are only four simple elements.
1. Earth
2. Water
3. Fire
4. Air

## Description
While the number of elements is very limited, each one shows unique behaviors and interacts with the other elements. The 2d-array of integers method of keeping track of elements has several limitation, with a lack of individual states for certain particles being the most evident.
